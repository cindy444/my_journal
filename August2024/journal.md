# August Progress & Appreciations

- 9th: Appeciated today to have received support from a mentor at work on Trees and Graphs! + Reviewing all FE basics. 

- 14th: Appreciated myself to put in the time for self-development and self-reflection. During the past two weeks of work, I am really grateful to be able to learn more about Java backend. Even though I still find I have a lot of places I still might not fully understand. It is okay. It is part of the learning process. Outside of work, I have watched through the following Taro courses to make sure I am well prepared for the upcoming year mindset for work: 
    - `Become The Go-To Expert As a Software Engineer` by Jordan Cutler (Senior Software Engineer at Pinterest)
    - `Managing Up: Build Effective Relationships With Your Boss` by Ethan Evans (Ex-Amazon VP)
